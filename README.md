Creating a Non Harmful Virus to prank on your friends or someone you like.



<*******************************************************>

Note: This virus is Harmless and can only shutdown the PC...
But I will not be responsible for anything if anything goes wrong with the PC....
Wanna Prank someone You love...
In this I have made a simple virus using notepad...
Just Open Notepad in your PC...
And type the following codes...


CODE:

@echo off
color 57
echo Hey, do you love me (only answer in yes or no)
set /p love=
if %love%==yes goto love
if %love%==no goto hate
:love
echo I love you too...
echo Meet you soon :)
pause 
exit
:hate
echo But I love you....hehehehehe
echo You are hacked...
echo Your PC will crash in 10 seconds
timeout 10
shutdown -s -t 10

After typing, Save the file as Love.bat
Now give this file to the person you want through pendrive or as an attachment and convince them to execute this file....

This virus is harmless and can only shutdown their PC if they type "NO" when the program asks them....
But I will not be responsible for anything if anything Goes wrong with their PC...
